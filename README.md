# MultiOmicQC

## Genomic annotation matching
Given two or more datasets on genomic intervals or with genomic build information:

### Simple sanity checks
- [ ] Check seqlevels match (and report mismatches)
- [ ] Check seqnames match (and report mismatches)
- [ ] Check seqlengths (or max seqlengths)

## Sample level checks
- [ ] Gender prediction
- [ ] Population prediction (genetic data)

## Dataset-level checks
- [ ] Sample correlations
- [ ] General outlier discovery in matrix-like data
